# Web Exploitation

This module is about web exploitation.

## SOAP

### Thought process and approach

The description states that the flag is stored in `/etc/passwd `. Opening the website, I had no clue what to do so I read the hints. It hinted that we need to use a XML external entity Injection. Searching for resources on this topic, I found this [article](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe) which explained the concept of XXE Injection. 

Whenever I click on details for any of the following, a xml request is sent to the server containing the specific id. Reading up on the article, I found that we can inject our own script to read the file `/flag.txt`.

I tried using Burp Suite to intercept the requests but I couldn't get it to work. So I used dev tools to copy the request as a curl command and imported it in Postman. Now I could modify the requests and get the corresponding responses. The article had a payload for a very similar case (even the file name was the same). I modified the payload as:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<data><ID>&xxe;</ID></data>
```

Sending this request, I got the flag.

### Resources used

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- [XXE Injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe)
  
### The FLAG

The flag is:

```
picoCTF{XML_3xtern@l_3nt1t1ty_e5f02dbf}
```

## Forbidden Paths 

### Thought process and approach 

Reading the description of the challenge, I understood that our flag is stored in `/flag.txt ` and the files for hosting the website are located at `/usr/share/nginx/html/`. When I visit the website, I find out that we can pass in any file path and it will display the contents of the file. But the challenge description clearly states that absolute file paths are filtered. 

Thanks to the cryptonite taskphase 1, I knew that we can bypass this by using relative paths. The `..` operator is used to go back a directory. and we are inside the `/usr/share/nginx/html/` directory. So, I tried to access the flag using the relative path `../../../flag.txt` and it displayed the flag.

### The FLAG

The flag is:

```
picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5a6fcbc}
```

## Cookies

### Thought process and approach 

After going to the site, I opened the developer tools and checked the cookies. I found a cookie named `name` with the value `-1`. Keeping the developer tools open, I entered `snickerdoodle` in the input box and click the `Search` button and the value of the cookie changed to `0`. I entered `chocolate chip` and the value changed to `1`. Every time I entered a value, the value of the cookie also changed. I wrote a python script that kept changing the value of the cookie and print out the response if it contained `picoCTF` in it. I looped through the values from 0 to 50.

```
import requests

for i in range(50):
    
    headers = {'Cookie': f'name={i}'}
    r = requests.get('http://mercury.picoctf.net:27177/check', headers=headers)
    if (r.status_code == 200) and ('picoCTF' in r.text):
        print(r.text)
        break
```

Running this script and waiting for a while it printed out the response. Saving it to a file and opening it, I found the flag.
